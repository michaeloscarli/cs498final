		<h1>  Project Motivation </h1>
		<br>
		<p>One of the toughest challenges facing VR is the problem of simulator sickness. Many people report headaches, nausea, and feelings of discomfort during and after the use of virtual reality systems. These issues not only impede the mainstream adoption of virtual reality, but they also limit the type of experiences that can be created by developers. In order for VR to reach its full potential, these problems must be overcome. Our goal is to make virtual reality a more comfortable experience by designing and studying different techniques that can be employed by developers to reduce simulator sickness in a variety of situations.</p>

		<h1> Project Description </h1>
		<br>
		<p>It is not precisely known why people experience sickness in virtual reality. One of the main challenges of our project involved theorizing potential causes of simulator and motion sickness based on class material and outside research. As mentioned in class, one source of sickness might arise from the mismatch between the visual and the vestibular systems. The eyes perceive motion while the vestibular organs do not. This leads us to our next challenge: suggesting plausible techniques and potential solutions to the problem. For our project, we limit ourselves to experimenting with techniques which involve first person character locomotion and optical flow.</p>

		<h2> Jump Blur </h2>

		<br>
		<p>The idea came from our discomfort with current jump mechanics and the particularly jarring feeling of landing.</p>

		<h2> Test Environments </h2>
		<br>
		<p>We design several test environments to simulate various VR situations which could induce discomfort in individuals. </p>

		<h1>  Project Findings </h1>
		<br>
		<p>Following development, we began our project's test phase, inviting any willing souls to participate in our controlled study. We collected data from 14 different people. Ideally, we would like to have had more participants, but this proved difficult to accomplish given time constraints and having no compensation to offer.</p>

<!-- Each team should create an html page that explains their project, including any screenshots and videos (which could be posted on YouTube).  The length of the page is not critical, as long as you cover the project idea, its novelty, technical challenges, what works well, your ideas for future work (by others), what fails, why you believe it is a comfortable experience (unless discomfort is the goal), and how you used the course concepts.  The deadline is noon on Saturday, May 16.  You are welcome to paste parts of your project proposal and adapt them as needed for the web page. -->
